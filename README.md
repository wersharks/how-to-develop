# how-to-develop
No bullsh*t, Just the practical way to code and develop softwares, applications, programs without wasting your time on _courses_, _teaching materials_ etc.
## Why?
Looking to jump into development journey? perhaps planning to learn react/flutter/webdev, or some cool sounding tech stack and get high paying jobs..? Don't worry, we got you covered (or maybe not).

## A word of caution

This godly almanac is made as rude as it could be, so it could unscrew your head and pour some useful knowledge to that shit of a brains you have been operating with until now. So if you are someone to get easily offended, take things personally, or perhaps straight up start cussing the author.. _Please leave_.

## How to read
The whole guide(or almanac) is divided into chapters, with each chapters explaining some things and concepts, please follow the order given in _Index_ and start reading from prologue!

### 1. Why are you reading this?
Soo...? Why exactly are you reading this almanac? Do you want something like x lakh package after reading this or think that at the end of reading everything you would be getting packages of y lakh/$/etc and would be living a luxurious life? Or do you think something of a Nodejs with a tint of django would be cool to flex your friends? Why exactly do you want to do development? Now if any of those motivatiors sounds similar to yours, dont worry I won't judge them but remember, all the hardwork will be your own, I won't be having honey fed spoof with which you would have learned everything and do development like its easy peasy! _Sorry it ain't that simple_

**So remember folks, do your own hardwork, there's no shortcut to the path of devgod (the hypothetical being of development perfection)**

and lastly, whatever it is.. for good or bad but _make up your mind for why do you want to jump into the world of development_, and tighten your seatbelt before jumping over next chapter, _because this, my friend, can turn out to be your first and last chapter read before dropping this almanac entirely and never touching upon it ever again!_
